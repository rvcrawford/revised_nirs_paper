	abstract = {Achieving global goals for sustainable nutrition, health, and wellbeing will depend on delivering enhanced diets to humankind. This will require instantaneous access to information on food-source quality at key points of agri-food systems. Although laboratory analysis and benchtop NIR spectrometers are regularly used to quantify grain quality, these do not suit all end users, for example, stakeholders in decentralized agri-food chains that are typical in emerging economies. Therefore, we explored benchtop and portable NIR instruments, and the methods that might aid these particular end uses. For this purpose, we generated NIR spectra for 328 grain samples from multiple cereals (finger millet, foxtail millet, maize, pearl millet, and sorghum) with a standard benchtop NIR spectrometer (DS2500, FOSS) and a novel portable NIR-based instrument (HL-EVT5, Hone). We explored classical deterministic methods (via winISI, FOSS), novel machine learning (ML)-driven methods (via Hone Create, Hone), and a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based method for building the calibrations to predict grain protein out of the NIR spectra. All of the tested methods enabled us to build relevant calibrations out of both types of spectra (i.e., R $^{\textrm{2}}$ ≥ 0.90, RMSE ≤ 0.91, RPD ≥ 3.08). Generally, the calibration methods integrating the ML techniques tended to enhance the prediction capacity of the model. We also documented that the prediction of grain protein content based on the NIR spectra generated using the novel portable instrument (HL-EVT5, Hone) was highly relevant for quantitative protein predictions (R $^{\textrm{2}}$ = 0.91, RMSE = 0.97, RPD = 3.48). Thus, the presented findings lay the foundations for the expanded use of NIR spectroscopy in agricultural research, development, and trade.},

Whole, ground and defatted ground soybean were scanned by a diode array NIR analyzer and defatted ground soybean were scanned by a Fourier transformed NIR analyzer. Samples were analyzed for crude protein and amino acid contents using reference wet chemistry methods. The NIR calibration models of crude protein and most amino acids showed acceptable coefficient of determinations (R2c = 0.605–0.952), while the NIR models for Cys, Met and Trp were less accurate (R2c = 0.498–0.667 for Cys and R2c = 0.482–0.615 for Met and R2c = 0.406–0.481 for Trp). The R2c values in NIR calibration were found to relate to the correlation between amino acids and crude protein. The grinding process and lipid extraction were found to improve the NIR spectroscopy in crude protein and amino acids prediction. The Fourier transformed NIR analyzer was found to perform similar to the diode array NIR analyzer for defatted ground soybean analysis. No significant differences were found between crude protein and amino acid contents predicted by these two NIR spectroscopy instruments (P {\textgreater} 0.05).},

The spectra of grains were measured in reflectance mode using lab made filter based pre dispersive NIRS ranging from wavelength 750 nm to 2580 nm. NIR Wavelengths were divided into two sets for all the stored samples depending on its correlation with factors. The reference data and NIR data were analysed by principal component analysis (PCA) scores, partial last squared regression (PLSR) model, Multiple Regression Analysis (MLR) and Support Vector Machine Regression (SVMR). First four factors were sufficient to develop regression models for the above mentioned methods. Prediction performance was compared on the basis of the coefficient of correlation (R2) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) for the calibration and validation sets. R2 values for prediction of protein content from PLSR model were 0.955, 0.997 for 4 °C Wavelength Set I and II and 0.903, 0.989 for 21 °C Wavelength Set I and II. For the prediction of carbohydrate content 0.978, 0.951 and 0.946, 0.974 were the R2 values for the 4 °C and 21 °C wheat samples Set I and Set II respectively. MLR model also gave R2 values greater than 0.9 for all the samples. Wavelengths with high β correlation coefficients were defined. SVMR predicted the protein content and carbohydrate content with good accuracy. SVMR and PLS results. All the models developed showed good accuracy for successful prediction of protein and carbohydrate content of stored wheat grains with PLSR and SVMR giving the best results. This study showed that near infrared spectroscopy has potential to distinguish wheat grains stored under different conditions.},

The 51A had a scanning range from 1596 to 1756 nm and 1988 to 2356 nm. The 102 scanned from 1902 to 2320 nm. Computer programs developed for the National NIR Forage Project were used to conduct the instrument comparisons tests. Agricultural products used in the experiment were hay, haylage, corn (Zea mays L.) silage and corn grain. Analyses included crude protein (CP), acid detergent fiber (ADF), Ca, P, K, M, and dry matter (DM). The 6100 generally had lower standard errors of validation than the scanning filter instruments. Although the six-filter 51A had more spectral information than the three-filter 102, it did not consistently out-perform the 102. There was no trend for one math treatment or series of wavelengths to be selected across instruments, products, or analyses. Regardless of the instrument spectral capabilities, the fraction of explained variance (R2) values for CP, ADF, and DM were higher than the R2s for the minerals. Even though the accuracy of the filter instruments was often below that of the scanning monochromator, the differences were small and would be of little significance for many agricultural applications.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: A near‐infrared (NIR) spectroscopy method was developed for rapid and nondestructive evaluation of protein content of intact sorghum grains. Effect of grain sample moisture variation on the robustness of protein calibration was investigated. FINDINGS: An initial NIR protein calibration model with sorghum grains in 7.28\%–11.57\% moisture content range with coefficient of determination (R²) of 0.94 and standard error of cross‐validation (SECV) of 0.41\%, predicted protein content of an external validation set of different varieties with R² = 0.90, root‐mean‐square error of prediction (RMSEP) = 0.42\% and bias = −0.02\%. However, when grains with a wider range of moisture content (7.50\%–17.75\%) were used for validation, prediction errors increased with R² = 0.72 RMSEP = 0.87\% and bias = −0.32\%. Inclusion of grains with a wider moisture range to the calibration set improved the performance of the calibration model with a R² = 0.83, RMSEP = 0.67\% with a bias of −0.04\%. CONCLUSIONS: Variation of moisture content in grains affected the performance of the NIR protein calibration model. Likewise, inclusion of moisture variation in the calibration sample set improved the robustness of the model. SIGNIFICANCE AND NOVELTY: In addition to the traits of interest, variation of other physical or chemical traits should also be considered for inclusion into the calibration sample set to improve the robustness of NIR calibration models. This is especially important when NIR spectroscopy methods are developed for evaluation of breeding populations as the future grain samples from numerous crosses may be substantially diverse.},

	abstract = {For many decades, near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) has been used to determine the composition of animal feedstuffs and grains. More recently, mid-infrared spectroscopy (mid-IR) has also been examined for similar determinations. These spectroscopic methods offer the potential for rapid and accurate determination of organic constituents, such as fiber components and protein, of forages, by-products, and grains at reduced cost and greatly increased speed (minutes instead of hours or days). Because they are nonchemical in nature, they result in a large reduction (90\% or more) in the chemical wastes associated with standard chemical-based assay methods. The same components of interest for biofuel production (cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin, starch, protein, oil, etc.) are those that have already been determined by NIRS/mid-IR for evaluating grains and animal feedstuffs. Therefore, these techniques would appear to be a natural match for evaluating feedstocks for biofuels, and the literature shows that efforts in this direction are being successfully tested and instituted. For this discussion, an overview of where such efforts are and the potential for NIRS/mid-IR in producing biofuels will be covered. For example, while there are similarities between the needs of the biofuels industry and the analysis of animal feedstuffs, there are also both practical and technical differences between the two that will likely impact how NIRS/mid-IR is developed for biofuels. As an example, grain analysis for protein is performed on a large scale by government agencies such as the Canadian Grain Commission and U.S. Grain Inspection Service, while at least in the United States, animal feedstuff analysis is performed by state or independent laboratories for individual farmers. For biofuels, this might well result in most analysis being performed by the large corporations converting the feedstocks to biofuels, as opposed to the individual producer having analysis performed at an independent laboratory. Similarly for animal feedstuffs, measurements of fiber (neutral detergent fiber or NDF, acid detergent fiber or ADF, and lignin) and protein are carried out. These fiber measurements often consist of more than one type of fiber component with some being computed by difference (hemicellulose = NDF – ADF) and are empirical at best. Whether such empirical estimates will be sufficient for assessing biofuels or whether new spectroscopic methods for directly measuring the components of interest (cellulose, etc.) will need to be developed is a question to be answered when components other than starch for ethanol or oil for biodiesel become common.},

In the current study, the influence of dehulling process on the chemical composition, structure and functional properties of hempseed protein isolate (HPI) was determined by using SDS-PAGE, SEC-HPLC-UV/RI/MALS, CD spectroscopy and DSC. The result demonstrated that dehulling process significantly increased the extraction and protein recovery yields of HPI. Meanwhile, dehulled HPI also exhibited a higher protein purity and Arg/Lys ratio with improved color. No significant impact on protein composition and structure was observed upon seed dehulling, but HPI extracted from the dehulled seeds showed a reduced thermal stability as compared to non-dehulled HPI. The aromatic profile of HPI was determined by HS-SPME-GC-MS, and the data suggested that dehulled HPI accumulated more terpenes and less lipid oxidation volatiles than non-dehulled HPI. These findings indicated that dehulling process greatly enhances the extraction yield with higher protein content and more characteristic aroma of HPI. The current study for the first time provides valuable information about the influence of dehulling processing on the properties of HPI, which will facilitate further research and application of hempseed and its valued added ingredients in both academic and industry field.},

	abstract = {The seed of Cannabis sativa L. has been an important source of nutrition for thousands of years in Old World cultures. Non-drug varieties of Cannabis, commonly referred to as hemp, have not been studied extensively for their nutritional potential in recent years, nor has hempseed been utilized to any great extent by the industrial processes and food markets that have developed during the 20th century. Technically a nut, hempseed typically contains over 30\% oil and about 25\% protein, with considerable amounts of dietary fiber, vitamins and minerals. Hempseed oil is over 80\% in polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), and is an exceptionally rich source of the two essential fatty acids (EFAs) linoleic acid (18:2 omega-6) and alpha-linolenic acid (18:3 omega-3). The omega-6 to omega-3 ratio (n6/n3) in hempseed oil is normally between 2:1 and 3:1, which is considered to be optimal for human health. In addition, the biological metabolites of the two EFAs, gamma-linolenic acid (18:3 omega-6; ‘GLA’) and stearidonic acid (18:4 omega-3; ‘SDA’), are also present in hempseed oil. The two main proteins in hempseed are edestin and albumin. Both of these high-quality storage proteins are easily digested and contain nutritionally significant amounts of all essential amino acids. In addition, hempseed has exceptionally high levels of the amino acid arginine. Hempseed has been used to treat various disorders for thousands of years in traditional oriental medicine. Recent clinical trials have identified hempseed oil as a functional food, and animal feeding studies demonstrate the long-standing utility of hempseed as an important food resource.},

	abstract = {As a source of nutritionally important components, hemp seeds are often dehulled for consumption and food applications by removing the hard hulls, which increases their nutritional value. The hulls thus become waste, although they may contain valuable protein items, about which there is a lack of information. The present work is therefore aimed at evaluating the proteome of hemp (Cannabis sativa L.) at the whole-seed, dehulled seed, and hull levels. The evaluation was performed on two cultivars, Santhica 27 and Uso-31, using LC-MS/MS analysis. In total, 2833 protein groups (PGs) were identified, and their relative abundances were determined. A set of 88 PGs whose abundance exceeded 1000 ppm (MP88 set) was considered for further evaluation. The PGs of the MP88 set were divided into ten protein classes. Seed storage proteins were found to be the most abundant protein class: the averages of the cultivars were 65.5\%, 71.3\%, and 57.5\% for whole seeds, dehulled seeds, and hulls, respectively. In particular, 11S globulins representing edestin (three PGs) were found, followed by 7S vicilin-like proteins (four PGs) and 2S albumins (two PGs). The storage 11S globulins in Santhica 27 and Uso-31 were found to have a higher relative abundance in the dehulled seed proteome (summing to 58.6 and 63.2\%) than in the hull proteome (50.5 and 54\%), respectively. The second most abundant class of proteins was oleosins, which are part of oil-body membranes. PGs belonging to metabolic proteins (e.g., energy metabolism, nucleic acid metabolism, and protein synthesis) and proteins related to the defence and stress responses were more abundant in the hulls than in the dehulled seeds. The hulls can, therefore, be an essential source of proteins, especially for medical and biotechnological applications. Proteomic analysis has proven to be a valuable tool for studying differences in the relative abundance of proteins between dehulled hemp seeds and their hulls among different cultivars.},

	abstract = {Grain protein content (GPC) is one of the most important criteria to determine the quality of common wheat (Triticum aestivum). One of the major obstacles for bread wheat production is the negative correlation between GPC and grain yield (GY). Previous studies demonstrated that the deviation from this inverse relationship is highly heritable. However, little is known about the genetics controlling these deviations in common wheat. To fill this gap, we performed quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis for GY, GPC, and four derived GY-GPC indices using an eight-way multiparent advanced generation intercross population comprising 394 lines. Interval mapping was conducted using phenotypic data from up to nine environments and genotypic data from a 20k single-nucleotide polymorphism array. The four indices were highly heritable (0.76–0.88) and showed distinct correlations to GY and GPC. Interval mapping revealed that GY, GPC, and GY-GPC indices were controlled by 6, 12, and 12 unique QTL, of which each explained only a small amount of phenotypic variance (R2 ≤ 10\%). Ten of the 12 index QTL were independent of loci affecting GY and GPC. QTL regions harboured several candidate genes, including Rht-1, WAPO-A1, TaTEF-7A, and NRT2.6-7A. The study confirmed the usefulness of indices to mitigate the inverse GY-GPC relationship in breeding, though the selection method should reflect their polygenic inheritance.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Wheat grain protein content (GPC) and yield components are complex quantitative traits influenced by a multi-factorial system consisting of both genetic and environmental factors. Although seed storage proteins represent less than 15\% of mature kernels, they are crucial in determining end-use properties of wheat, as well as the nutritional value of derived products. Yield and GPC are negatively correlated, and this hampers breeding programs of commercially valuable wheat varieties. The goal of this work was the evaluation of genetic variability for quantity and composition of seed storage proteins, together with yield components [grain yield per spike (GYS) and thousand-kernel weight (TKW)] in a durum wheat population obtained by an inter-specific cross between a common wheat accession and the durum cv. Saragolla. Quantitative trait loci (QTL) analysis was conducted and closely associated markers identified on a genetic map composed of 4,366 SNP markers previously obtained in the same durum population genotyped with the 90K iSelect SNP assay. A total of 22 QTL were detected for traits related to durum wheat quality. Six genomic regions responsible for GPC control were mapped on chromosomes 2B, 3A, 4A, 4B, 5B, and 7B, with major QTL on chromosomes 2B, 4A, and 5B. Nine loci were detected for GYS: two on chromosome 5B and 7A and one on chromosomes 2A, 2B, 4A, 4B, 7B, with the strongest QTL on 2B. Eight QTL were identified for TKW, three of which located on chromosome 3A, two on 1B and one on 4B, 5A, and 5B. Only small overlapping was found among QTL for GYS, TKW, and GPC, and increasing alleles coming from both parents on different chromosomes. Good candidate genes were identified in the QTL confidence intervals for GYS and TKW.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Cannabis sativa, more commonly referred to as industrial hemp, has been used for fiber, food, and medicinal purposes for millennia. Temporarily suffering a setback for parts of the 20th and 21st centuries, interest in hemp production has resurged with the recent rollback of legislative restrictions. Most notably, an interest in the nutritional profile of hemp seed has developed based on its rich array of fatty acids and protein. The increase in hemp production has led to a reciprocating increase in the availability of hemp seed and its associated by-products. While anecdotal and historical accounts exist for feeding hemp to livestock, published reports are limited. This is further complicated by a lack of acceptance in many countries for feeding hemp to livestock. Livestock’s ability to consume unusable waste products from various commodities and turn them into consumable goods is a major component of sustainable agriculture. Research indicates that dietary enrichment with hemp has the potential as a valuable source of protein, fat, and fiber to increase the quality and composition of meat, milk, and eggs; however, to what extent remains unknown. This review aims to explore the nutrient profile of the industrial hemp plant and evaluate our current understanding of hemp used in livestock diets.},

Interactions between grain yield and biochemical traits can be useful to plant breeders in making informed decisions on the traits to be considered in breeding programs for high grain yield and enhanced quality. The objectives of this study were to estimate the heritability of grain yield and its related traits, as well as quality traits, and determine the association between quality protein maize (QPM) with non-QPM crosses. Grain yield, and agronomic and quality trait data were obtained from 13 field trials in two countries, for two consecutive seasons. Significant genotypic and phenotypic correlations were recorded for grain yield with protein content (rG = 0.38; rP = 0.25), and tryptophan with oil content (rG = 0.58; rP = 0.25), and negative rG and rP correlations were found for protein with tryptophan content and grain yield with tryptophan content. Path analysis identified ear aspect, ears per plant, and starch as the major traits contributing to grain yield. It is recommended that ear aspect should be considered a key secondary trait in breeding for QPM hybrids. The negative association between grain yield and tryptophan, and between protein and tryptophan, will make it difficult to develop hybrids with high grain yield and high tryptophan content. Hence, it is recommended that gene pyramiding should be considered for these traits.},

This very large number of identifications was achieved by searching in two databases: Cannabis sativa L. (56 gene products identified) and Arabidopsis thaliana (125 gene products identified). By performing a protein–protein association network analysis using the STRING software, it was possible to build the first interactomic map of all detected proteins, characterized by 137 nodes and 410 interactions. Finally, a Gene Ontology analysis of the identified species permitted to classify their molecular functions: the great majority is involved in the seed metabolic processes (41\%), responses to stimulus (8\%), and biological process (7\%).
Biological significance
Hempseed is an underexploited non-legume protein-rich seed. Although its protein is well known for its digestibility, essential amino acid composition, and useful techno-functional properties, a comprehensive proteome characterization is still lacking. The objective of this work was to fill this knowledge gap and provide information useful for a better exploitation of this seed in different food products.},

However, the feasibility for determining the critical biochemicals, related to the classifications for food, feed, and fuel products are not adequately investigated. Fourier-transform (FT) NIR was applied in this study to determine the eight biochemicals in four types of sorghum samples: hulled grain flours, hull-less grain flours, whole grains, and grain flours. A total of 20 hybrids of sorghum grains were selected from the two locations in China. Followed by FT-NIR spectral and wet-chemically measured biochemical data, partial least squares regression (PLSR) was used to construct the prediction models. The results showed that sorghum grain morphology and sample format affected the prediction of biochemicals. Using NIR data of grain flours generally improved the prediction compared with the use of NIR data of whole grains. In addition, using the spectra of whole grains enabled comparable predictions, which are recommended when a non-destructive and rapid analysis is required. Compared with the hulled grain flours, hull-less grain flours allowed for improved predictions for tannin, cellulose, and hemicellulose using NIR data. This study aimed to provide a reference for the evaluation of sorghum grain biochemicals for food, feed, and fuel without destruction and complex chemical analysis.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Today, NIR spectroscopy is envisioned as replacing laboratory analysis in certain applications (e.g., soil-carbon-credit assessment at the farm level). However, accuracy is still unsatisfactory compared with standard laboratory procedures, leading some authors to think that such a challenge will never be met. This article investigates the critical points to be aware of when accuracy of NIR-based measurements is assessed. First is the decomposition of the standard error of prediction into components of bias and variance, only the latter being reducible by averaging. This decomposition is not used routinely in the soil-science literature. Contrarily, a log-normal distribution of reference values is very often encountered with soil samples [e.g., elemental concentrations (e.g., carbon)] with numerous small or zero values. These very skewed distributions make us take precautions when using inverse regression methods (e.g., principal component regression or partial least squares), which force the predictions towards the centre of the calibration set, leading to negative effects on the standard error prediction – and therefore on prediction accuracy – especially when log-normal distributions are encountered. Such distributions, which are very common for soil components, also make the ratio of performance to deviation a useless, even hazardous, tool, leading to erroneous conclusions. We propose a new index based on the quartiles of the empirical distribution – ratio of performance to inter-quartile distance – to overcome this problem.},

This article investigates the critical points to be aware of when accuracy of NIR-based measurements is assessed. First is the decomposition of the standard error of prediction into components of bias and variance, only the latter being reducible by averaging. This decomposition is not used routinely in the soil-science literature. Contrarily, a log-normal distribution of reference values is very often encountered with soil samples [e.g., elemental concentrations (e.g., carbon)] with numerous small or zero values. These very skewed distributions make us take precautions when using inverse regression methods (e.g., principal component regression or partial least squares), which force the predictions towards the centre of the calibration set, leading to negative effects on the standard error prediction – and therefore on prediction accuracy – especially when log-normal distributions are encountered. Such distributions, which are very common for soil components, also make the ratio of performance to deviation a useless, even hazardous, tool, leading to erroneous conclusions. We propose a new index based on the quartiles of the empirical distribution – ratio of performance to inter-quartile distance – to overcome this problem.},

	abstract = {Relating a set of variables X to a response y is crucial in chemometrics. A quantitative prediction objective can be enriched by qualitative data interpretation, for instance by locating the most influential features. When high-dimensional problems arise, dimension reduction techniques can be used. Most notable are projections (e.g. Partial Least Squares or PLS ) or variable selections (e.g. lasso). Sparse partial least squares combine both strategies, by blending variable selection into PLS. The variant presented in this paper, Dual-sPLS, generalizes the classical PLS1 algorithm. It provides balance between accurate prediction and efficient interpretation. It is based on penalizations inspired by classical regression methods (lasso, group lasso, least squares, ridge) and uses the dual norm notion. The resulting sparsity is enforced by an intuitive shrinking ratio parameter. Dual-sPLS favorably compares to similar regression methods, on simulated and real chemical data.},

PLSR is a method for relating two data matrices, X and Y, by a linear multivariate model, but goes beyond traditional regression in that it models also the structure of X and Y. PLSR derives its usefulness from its ability to analyze data with many, noisy, collinear, and even incomplete variables in both X and Y. PLSR has the desirable property that the precision of the model parameters improves with the increasing number of relevant variables and observations. This article reviews PLSR as it has developed to become a standard tool in chemometrics and used in chemistry and engineering. The underlying model and its assumptions are discussed, and commonly used diagnostics are reviewed together with the interpretation of resulting parameters. Two examples are used as illustrations: First, a Quantitative Structure–Activity Relationship (QSAR)/Quantitative Structure–Property Relationship (QSPR) data set of peptides is used to outline how to develop, interpret and refine a PLSR model. Second, a data set from the manufacturing of recycled paper is analyzed to illustrate time series modelling of process data by means of PLSR and time-lagged X-variables.},

The reaction is presently monitored off-line by HPLC. The calibration models are based on spectra measured on-line. The process solution is chemically complex and the intention of this study was to enhance knowledge about the predictive ability of the models. Different data-preprocessing and variable selection methods reported in the literature have been tested in order to enhance chemical information and reduce irrelevant variability due to physical influences on measured spectra such as scattering and temperature. In addition to standard preprocessing methods such as normalization, differentiation and multiplicative scatter correction, orthogonal signal correction and optimized scaling were tested. The modelling was performed by partial least squares (PLS), except for optimized scaling which uses principal component regression (PCR). Optimized scaling on differentiated data gave the lowest prediction error. The NIR region from 1100 to 1900 nm gave better models than variable selection and fewer variables. Models with correlation coefficients for best fit equal to 0.998 and 0.961 were obtained for the initial reactant and the impurity, respectively. Copyright © 2002 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Multiplicative combinations of these effects are the major factor inhibiting the interpretation of near-infrared diffuse reflectance spectra. Sample particle size accounts for the majority of the variance, while variance due to chemical composition is small. Procedures are presented whereby physical and chemical variance can be separated. Mathematical transformations—standard normal variate (SNV) and de-trending (DT)—applicable to individual NIR diffuse reflectance spectra are presented. The standard normal variate approach effectively removes the multiplicative interferences of scatter and particle size. De-trending accounts for the variation in baseline shift and curvilinearity, generally found in the reflectance spectra of powdered or densely packed samples, with the use of a second-degree polynomial regression. NIR diffuse reflectance spectra transposed by these methods are free from multi-collinearity and are not confused by the complexity of shape encountered with the use of derivative spectroscopy.},

	abstract = {Growing trends towards the development of rapid, simple, and cost-effective methodologies for grain quality monitoring have been observed for a long time. Infrared spectroscopy associated with chemometrics has proven to be a promising alternative to traditional wet chemistry methods. So far comparative research that focuses on the relation between spectral preprocessing, wavelength selection, and model performance is rare. This paper aims to explore the effect of spectral preprocessing and wavelengths selection on the performance of partial least square (PLS) regression models constructed with near-infrared (NIR) and mid-infrared (ATR-FT/MIR) spectroscopy. Eighty wheat samples were randomly selected in Western Canada. NIR (680–2500 nm) and MIR (4000–700 cm−1) spectra were collected and calibrated with reference crude protein (CP) and moisture content using PLS regression technique based on different spectral preprocessing methods and selected important wavelengths. In a general way, the models generated with NIR spectra showed superior performance than that developed with MIR spectra. For CP, the best NIR model was developed with the 1400–2500 nm spectral range of standard normal variate (SNV) and first derivative (FD) pretreated spectra, which showed an excellent prediction performance (R2 = 0.97); the best MIR model was established using the 1750–1100 cm−1 region of SNV corrected spectra, which gave a good predictive ability (R2 = 0.90). Regarding to the moisture, the best model obtained by NIR technique (based on the 1100–2500 nm region of raw spectra) showed a good prediction performance (R2 = 0.86), while the best model generated by MIR technique (using the full wavenumber range of FD-SNV preprocessed spectra) only gave approximate quantitative prediction (R2 = 0.72). Both spectral preprocessing and wavelength selection could affect the performance of PLS models for predicting CP and moisture content in wheat. More effort is needed to improve the performance of ATR-FT/MIR spectroscopy for quantitative analysis based on appropriate chemometrics tools.},

In the paper, the properties of the SGDD are discussed in detail. The effects of the SGDD on a noise-free single Gaussian line and a noise-free Gaussian doublet are studied via simulation. The results indicate that the contrast and resolution loss of the SGDD depends on the ratio of the width of signal derivative and filter length. The linear SGDD is not preferable for preserving small details of signal derivative from this study.

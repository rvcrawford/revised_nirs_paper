	abstract = {This study was designed to examine the ability of near-infrared ({NIR}) spectroscopy to determine amino acid and crude protein concentrations in soybean and explore the effects of particle size, fat content and types of {NIR} spectroscopy instruments on the predictive ability of the {NIR} models. Whole, ground and defatted ground soybean were scanned by a diode array {NIR} analyzer and defatted ground soybean were scanned by a Fourier transformed {NIR} analyzer. Samples were analyzed for crude protein and amino acid contents using reference wet chemistry methods. The {NIR} calibration models of crude protein and most amino acids showed acceptable coefficient of determinations (R2c = 0.605–0.952), while the {NIR} models for Cys, Met and Trp were less accurate (R2c = 0.498–0.667 for Cys and R2c = 0.482–0.615 for Met and R2c = 0.406–0.481 for Trp). The R2c values in {NIR} calibration were found to relate to the correlation between amino acids and crude protein. The grinding process and lipid extraction were found to improve the {NIR} spectroscopy in crude protein and amino acids prediction. The Fourier transformed {NIR} analyzer was found to perform similar to the diode array {NIR} analyzer for defatted ground soybean analysis. No significant differences were found between crude protein and amino acid contents predicted by these two {NIR} spectroscopy instruments (P {\textbackslash}textgreater 0.05).},

	abstract = {Aim of the study was to predict quality parameters namely protein and carbohydrate content of wheat grain stored for one year at 4 °C and 21 °C using Near Infrared spectroscopy ({NIRS}) and Chemometrics. The spectra of grains were measured in reflectance mode using lab made filter based pre dispersive {NIRS} ranging from wavelength 750 nm to 2580 nm. {NIR} Wavelengths were divided into two sets for all the stored samples depending on its correlation with factors. The reference data and {NIR} data were analysed by principal component analysis ({PCA}) scores, partial last squared regression ({PLSR}) model, Multiple Regression Analysis ({MLR}) and Support Vector Machine Regression ({SVMR}). First four factors were sufficient to develop regression models for the above mentioned methods. Prediction performance was compared on the basis of the coefficient of correlation (R2) and Root Mean Square Error ({RMSE}) for the calibration and validation sets. R2 values for prediction of protein content from {PLSR} model were 0.955, 0.997 for 4 °C Wavelength Set I and {II} and 0.903, 0.989 for 21 °C Wavelength Set I and {II}. For the prediction of carbohydrate content 0.978, 0.951 and 0.946, 0.974 were the R2 values for the 4 °C and 21 °C wheat samples Set I and Set {II} respectively. {MLR} model also gave R2 values greater than 0.9 for all the samples. Wavelengths with high β correlation coefficients were defined. {SVMR} predicted the protein content and carbohydrate content with good accuracy. {SVMR} and {PLS} results. All the models developed showed good accuracy for successful prediction of protein and carbohydrate content of stored wheat grains with {PLSR} and {SVMR} giving the best results.

All instruments used in this test were manufactured by Pacific Scientific, Silver Spring, {MD}. The monochromator was the 6100 with a scanning range of 1100 to 2498 nm. The 51A had a scanning range from 1596 to 1756 nm and 1988 to 2356 nm. The 102 scanned from 1902 to 2320 nm. Computer programs developed for the National {NIR} Forage Project were used to conduct the instrument comparisons tests. Agricultural products used in the experiment were hay, haylage, corn (Zea mays L.) silage and corn grain. Analyses included crude protein ({CP}), acid detergent fiber ({ADF}), Ca, P, K, M, and dry matter ({DM}). The 6100 generally had lower standard errors of validation than the scanning filter instruments. Although the six-filter 51A had more spectral information than the three-filter 102, it did not consistently out-perform the 102. There was no trend for one math treatment or series of wavelengths to be selected across instruments, products, or analyses. Regardless of the instrument spectral capabilities, the fraction of explained variance (R2) values for {CP}, {ADF}, and {DM} were higher than the R2s for the minerals. Even though the accuracy of the filter instruments was often below that of the scanning monochromator, the differences were small and would be of little significance for many agricultural applications.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND} {AND} {OBJECTIVES}: A near‐infrared ({NIR}) spectroscopy method was developed for rapid and nondestructive evaluation of protein content of intact sorghum grains. Effect of grain sample moisture variation on the robustness of protein calibration was investigated. {FINDINGS}: An initial {NIR} protein calibration model with sorghum grains in 7.28\%–11.57\% moisture content range with coefficient of determination (R²) of 0.94 and standard error of cross‐validation ({SECV}) of 0.41\%, predicted protein content of an external validation set of different varieties with R² = 0.90, root‐mean‐square error of prediction ({RMSEP}) = 0.42\% and bias = −0.02\%. However, when grains with a wider range of moisture content (7.50\%–17.75\%) were used for validation, prediction errors increased with R² = 0.72 {RMSEP} = 0.87\% and bias = −0.32\%. Inclusion of grains with a wider moisture range to the calibration set improved the performance of the calibration model with a R² = 0.83, {RMSEP} = 0.67\% with a bias of −0.04\%. {CONCLUSIONS}: Variation of moisture content in grains affected the performance of the {NIR} protein calibration model. Likewise, inclusion of moisture variation in the calibration sample set improved the robustness of the model. {SIGNIFICANCE} {AND} {NOVELTY}: In addition to the traits of interest, variation of other physical or chemical traits should also be considered for inclusion into the calibration sample set to improve the robustness of {NIR} calibration models. This is especially important when {NIR} spectroscopy methods are developed for evaluation of breeding populations as the future grain samples from numerous crosses may be substantially diverse.},

	abstract = {For many decades, near-infrared spectroscopy ({NIRS}) has been used to determine the composition of animal feedstuffs and grains. More recently, mid-infrared spectroscopy (mid-{IR}) has also been examined for similar determinations. These spectroscopic methods offer the potential for rapid and accurate determination of organic constituents, such as fiber components and protein, of forages, by-products, and grains at reduced cost and greatly increased speed (minutes instead of hours or days). Because they are nonchemical in nature, they result in a large reduction (90\% or more) in the chemical wastes associated with standard chemical-based assay methods. The same components of interest for biofuel production (cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin, starch, protein, oil, etc.) are those that have already been determined by {NIRS}/mid-{IR} for evaluating grains and animal feedstuffs. Therefore, these techniques would appear to be a natural match for evaluating feedstocks for biofuels, and the literature shows that efforts in this direction are being successfully tested and instituted. For this discussion, an overview of where such efforts are and the potential for {NIRS}/mid-{IR} in producing biofuels will be covered. For example, while there are similarities between the needs of the biofuels industry and the analysis of animal feedstuffs, there are also both practical and technical differences between the two that will likely impact how {NIRS}/mid-{IR} is developed for biofuels. As an example, grain analysis for protein is performed on a large scale by government agencies such as the Canadian Grain Commission and U.S. Grain Inspection Service, while at least in the United States, animal feedstuff analysis is performed by state or independent laboratories for individual farmers. For biofuels, this might well result in most analysis being performed by the large corporations converting the feedstocks to biofuels, as opposed to the individual producer having analysis performed at an independent laboratory. Similarly for animal feedstuffs, measurements of fiber (neutral detergent fiber or {NDF}, acid detergent fiber or {ADF}, and lignin) and protein are carried out. These fiber measurements often consist of more than one type of fiber component with some being computed by difference (hemicellulose = {NDF} – {ADF}) and are empirical at best. Whether such empirical estimates will be sufficient for assessing biofuels or whether new spectroscopic methods for directly measuring the components of interest (cellulose, etc.) will need to be developed is a question to be answered when components other than starch for ethanol or oil for biodiesel become common.},

The result demonstrated that dehulling process significantly increased the extraction and protein recovery yields of {HPI}. Meanwhile, dehulled {HPI} also exhibited a higher protein purity and Arg/Lys ratio with improved color.

The aromatic profile of {HPI} was determined by {HS}-{SPME}-{GC}-{MS}, and the data suggested that dehulled {HPI} accumulated more terpenes and less lipid oxidation volatiles than non-dehulled {HPI}. These findings indicated that dehulling process greatly enhances the extraction yield with higher protein content and more characteristic aroma of {HPI}.

	abstract = {The seed of Cannabis sativa L. has been an important source of nutrition for thousands of years in Old World cultures. Non-drug varieties of Cannabis, commonly referred to as hemp, have not been studied extensively for their nutritional potential in recent years, nor has hempseed been utilized to any great extent by the industrial processes and food markets that have developed during the 20th century. Technically a nut, hempseed typically contains over 30\% oil and about 25\% protein, with considerable amounts of dietary fiber, vitamins and minerals. Hempseed oil is over 80\% in polyunsaturated fatty acids ({PUFAs}), and is an exceptionally rich source of the two essential fatty acids ({EFAs}) linoleic acid (18:2 omega-6) and alpha-linolenic acid (18:3 omega-3). The omega-6 to omega-3 ratio (n6/n3) in hempseed oil is normally between 2:1 and 3:1, which is considered to be optimal for human health. In addition, the biological metabolites of the two {EFAs}, gamma-linolenic acid (18:3 omega-6; ‘{GLA}’) and stearidonic acid (18:4 omega-3; ‘{SDA}’), are also present in hempseed oil. The two main proteins in hempseed are edestin and albumin. Both of these high-quality storage proteins are easily digested and contain nutritionally significant amounts of all essential amino acids. In addition, hempseed has exceptionally high levels of the amino acid arginine. Hempseed has been used to treat various disorders for thousands of years in traditional oriental medicine. Recent clinical trials have identified hempseed oil as a functional food, and animal feeding studies demonstrate the long-standing utility of hempseed as an important food resource.},

	abstract = {As a source of nutritionally important components, hemp seeds are often dehulled for consumption and food applications by removing the hard hulls, which increases their nutritional value. The hulls thus become waste, although they may contain valuable protein items, about which there is a lack of information. The present work is therefore aimed at evaluating the proteome of hemp (Cannabis sativa L.) at the whole-seed, dehulled seed, and hull levels. The evaluation was performed on two cultivars, Santhica 27 and Uso-31, using {LC}-{MS}/{MS} analysis. In total, 2833 protein groups ({PGs}) were identified, and their relative abundances were determined. A set of 88 {PGs} whose abundance exceeded 1000 ppm ({MP}88 set) was considered for further evaluation. The {PGs} of the {MP}88 set were divided into ten protein classes. Seed storage proteins were found to be the most abundant protein class: the averages of the cultivars were 65.5\%, 71.3\%, and 57.5\% for whole seeds, dehulled seeds, and hulls, respectively. In particular, 11S globulins representing edestin (three {PGs}) were found, followed by 7S vicilin-like proteins (four {PGs}) and 2S albumins (two {PGs}). The storage 11S globulins in Santhica 27 and Uso-31 were found to have a higher relative abundance in the dehulled seed proteome (summing to 58.6 and 63.2\%) than in the hull proteome (50.5 and 54\%), respectively. The second most abundant class of proteins was oleosins, which are part of oil-body membranes. {PGs} belonging to metabolic proteins (e.g., energy metabolism, nucleic acid metabolism, and protein synthesis) and proteins related to the defence and stress responses were more abundant in the hulls than in the dehulled seeds. The hulls can, therefore, be an essential source of proteins, especially for medical and biotechnological applications. Proteomic analysis has proven to be a valuable tool for studying differences in the relative abundance of proteins between dehulled hemp seeds and their hulls among different cultivars.},

	abstract = {Grain protein content ({GPC}) is one of the most important criteria to determine the quality of common wheat (Triticum aestivum). One of the major obstacles for bread wheat production is the negative correlation between {GPC} and grain yield ({GY}). Previous studies demonstrated that the deviation from this inverse relationship is highly heritable. However, little is known about the genetics controlling these deviations in common wheat. To fill this gap, we performed quantitative trait locus ({QTL}) analysis for {GY}, {GPC}, and four derived {GY}-{GPC} indices using an eight-way multiparent advanced generation intercross population comprising 394 lines. Interval mapping was conducted using phenotypic data from up to nine environments and genotypic data from a 20k single-nucleotide polymorphism array. The four indices were highly heritable (0.76–0.88) and showed distinct correlations to {GY} and {GPC}. Interval mapping revealed that {GY}, {GPC}, and {GY}-{GPC} indices were controlled by 6, 12, and 12 unique {QTL}, of which each explained only a small amount of phenotypic variance (R2 ≤ 10\%). Ten of the 12 index {QTL} were independent of loci affecting {GY} and {GPC}. {QTL} regions harboured several candidate genes, including Rht-1, {WAPO}-A1, {TaTEF}-7A, and {NRT}2.6-7A. The study confirmed the usefulness of indices to mitigate the inverse {GY}-{GPC} relationship in breeding, though the selection method should reflect their polygenic inheritance.},

Although seed storage proteins represent less than 15\% of mature kernels, they are crucial in determining end-use properties of wheat, as well as the nutritional value of derived products. Yield and {GPC} are negatively correlated, and this hampers breeding programs of commercially valuable wheat varieties. The goal of this work was the evaluation of genetic variability for quantity and composition of seed storage proteins, together with yield components [grain yield per spike ({GYS}) and thousand-kernel weight ({TKW})] in a durum wheat population obtained by an inter-specific cross between a common wheat accession and the durum cv. Saragolla. Quantitative trait loci ({QTL}) analysis was conducted and closely associated markers identified on a genetic map composed of 4,366 {SNP} markers previously obtained in the same durum population genotyped with the 90K {iSelect} {SNP} assay. A total of 22 {QTL} were detected for traits related to durum wheat quality. Six genomic regions responsible for {GPC} control were mapped on chromosomes 2B, 3A, 4A, 4B, 5B, and 7B, with major {QTL} on chromosomes 2B, 4A, and 5B. Nine loci were detected for {GYS}: two on chromosome 5B and 7A and one on chromosomes 2A, 2B, 4A, 4B, 7B, with the strongest {QTL} on 2B. Eight {QTL} were identified for {TKW}, three of which located on chromosome 3A, two on 1B and one on 4B, 5A, and 5B. Only small overlapping was found among {QTL} for {GYS}, {TKW}, and {GPC}, and increasing alleles coming from both parents on different chromosomes. Good candidate genes were identified in the {QTL} confidence intervals for {GYS} and {TKW}.{\textbackslash}textless/p{\textbackslash}textgreater},

	abstract = {Cannabis sativa, more commonly referred to as industrial hemp, has been used for fiber, food, and medicinal purposes for millennia. Temporarily suffering a setback for parts of the 20th and 21st centuries, interest in hemp production has resurged with the recent rollback of legislative restrictions. Most notably, an interest in the nutritional profile of hemp seed has developed based on its rich array of fatty acids and protein. The increase in hemp production has led to a reciprocating increase in the availability of hemp seed and its associated by-products. While anecdotal and historical accounts exist for feeding hemp to livestock, published reports are limited. This is further complicated by a lack of acceptance in many countries for feeding hemp to livestock. Livestock’s ability to consume unusable waste products from various commodities and turn them into consumable goods is a major component of sustainable agriculture. Research indicates that dietary enrichment with hemp has the potential as a valuable source of protein, fat, and fiber to increase the quality and composition of meat, milk, and eggs; however, to what extent remains unknown. This review aims to explore the nutrient profile of the industrial hemp plant and evaluate our current understanding of hemp used in livestock diets.},

The objectives of this study were to estimate the heritability of grain yield and its related traits, as well as quality traits, and determine the association between quality protein maize ({QPM}) with non-{QPM} crosses. Grain yield, and agronomic and quality trait data were obtained from 13 field trials in two countries, for two consecutive seasons. Significant genotypic and phenotypic correlations were recorded for grain yield with protein content ({rG} = 0.38; {rP} = 0.25), and tryptophan with oil content ({rG} = 0.58; {rP} = 0.25), and negative {rG} and {rP} correlations were found for protein with tryptophan content and grain yield with tryptophan content. Path analysis identified ear aspect, ears per plant, and starch as the major traits contributing to grain yield. It is recommended that ear aspect should be considered a key secondary trait in breeding for {QPM} hybrids. The negative association between grain yield and tryptophan, and between protein and tryptophan, will make it difficult to develop hybrids with high grain yield and high tryptophan content. Hence, it is recommended that gene pyramiding should be considered for these traits.},

The difference in optical density between 1.80 and 1.725 p gave a high correlation with moisture content and the difference between 1.725 and 1.65 P gave a high correlation with fat content. Direct spectrophotometric analysis predicted fat content within a standard error of ± 2.1\% and moisture content within ± 1.4\%.

However, the feasibility for determining the critical biochemicals, related to the classifications for food, feed, and fuel products are not adequately investigated. Fourier-transform ({FT}) {NIR} was applied in this study to determine the eight biochemicals in four types of sorghum samples: hulled grain flours, hull-less grain flours, whole grains, and grain flours. A total of 20 hybrids of sorghum grains were selected from the two locations in China. Followed by {FT}-{NIR} spectral and wet-chemically measured biochemical data, partial least squares regression ({PLSR}) was used to construct the prediction models. The results showed that sorghum grain morphology and sample format affected the prediction of biochemicals. Using {NIR} data of grain flours generally improved the prediction compared with the use of {NIR} data of whole grains. In addition, using the spectra of whole grains enabled comparable predictions, which are recommended when a non-destructive and rapid analysis is required. Compared with the hulled grain flours, hull-less grain flours allowed for improved predictions for tannin, cellulose, and hemicellulose using {NIR} data.

	abstract = {Near-infrared ({NIR}) and mid-{IR} spectroscopy applied to soil compositional analysis started to develop markedly in the 1990s, taking advantage of earlier advances in instrumentation and chemometrics for agricultural products. Today, {NIR} spectroscopy is envisioned as replacing laboratory analysis in certain applications (e.g., soil-carbon-credit assessment at the farm level). However, accuracy is still unsatisfactory compared with standard laboratory procedures, leading some authors to think that such a challenge will never be met. This article investigates the critical points to be aware of when accuracy of {NIR}-based measurements is assessed. First is the decomposition of the standard error of prediction into components of bias and variance, only the latter being reducible by averaging. This decomposition is not used routinely in the soil-science literature. Contrarily, a log-normal distribution of reference values is very often encountered with soil samples [e.g., elemental concentrations (e.g., carbon)] with numerous small or zero values. These very skewed distributions make us take precautions when using inverse regression methods (e.g., principal component regression or partial least squares), which force the predictions towards the centre of the calibration set, leading to negative effects on the standard error prediction – and therefore on prediction accuracy – especially when log-normal distributions are encountered. Such distributions, which are very common for soil components, also make the ratio of performance to deviation a useless, even hazardous, tool, leading to erroneous conclusions. We propose a new index based on the quartiles of the empirical distribution – ratio of performance to inter-quartile distance – to overcome this problem.},

In addition to standard preprocessing methods such as normalization, differentiation and multiplicative scatter correction, orthogonal signal correction and optimized scaling were tested. The modelling was performed by partial least squares ({PLS}), except for optimized scaling which uses principal component regression ({PCR}). Optimized scaling on differentiated data gave the lowest prediction error. The {NIR} region from 1100 to 1900 nm gave better models than variable selection and fewer variables.

Infrared spectroscopy associated with chemometrics has proven to be a promising alternative to traditional wet chemistry methods. So far comparative research that focuses on the relation between spectral preprocessing, wavelength selection, and model performance is rare. This paper aims to explore the effect of spectral preprocessing and wavelengths selection on the performance of partial least square ({PLS}) regression models constructed with near-infrared ({NIR}) and mid-infrared ({ATR}-{FT}/{MIR}) spectroscopy. Eighty wheat samples were randomly selected in Western Canada. {NIR} (680–2500 nm) and {MIR} (4000–700 cm−1) spectra were collected and calibrated with reference crude protein ({CP}) and moisture content using {PLS} regression technique based on different spectral preprocessing methods and selected important wavelengths. In a general way, the models generated with {NIR} spectra showed superior performance than that developed with {MIR} spectra. For {CP}, the best {NIR} model was developed with the 1400–2500 nm spectral range of standard normal variate ({SNV}) and first derivative ({FD}) pretreated spectra, which showed an excellent prediction performance (R2 = 0.97); the best {MIR} model was established using the 1750–1100 cm−1 region of {SNV} corrected spectra, which gave a good predictive ability (R2 = 0.90). Regarding to the moisture, the best model obtained by {NIR} technique (based on the 1100–2500 nm region of raw spectra) showed a good prediction performance (R2 = 0.86), while the best model generated by {MIR} technique (using the full wavenumber range of {FD}-{SNV} preprocessed spectra) only gave approximate quantitative prediction (R2 = 0.72). Both spectral preprocessing and wavelength selection could affect the performance of {PLS} models for predicting {CP} and moisture content in wheat. More effort is needed to improve the performance of {ATR}-{FT}/{MIR} spectroscopy for quantitative analysis based on appropriate chemometrics tools.},

This study investigated the potential usability of combining mid infrared({MIR}) and Raman for the quantification of {HFGS} (high fructose syrup) in bass honey blends. Where in the partial least squares ({PLS}) model was established to predict the concentration of the adulterant. Three data fusion strategies (low, mid and high-level) were applied to take advantage of the synergistic effect of chemical information from {MIR} and Raman, and adopted three high-level data fusion strategies to improve the prediction accuracy of the quantitative model. After data fusion, the {RMSEP} of high-level (1–3) were better than {MIR} (1.93) and Raman (2.30). Besides, calibration coefficient of determination (R2) and the {RMSECV} of high-level data fusion (1–3)also outperformed Raman (0.80, 3.38) and {MIR} (0.95,1.63).Results showed that: (1) The chemical information obtained from {MIR} and Raman have complementary advantages.

In the paper, the properties of the {SGDD} are discussed in detail. The effects of the {SGDD} on a noise-free single Gaussian line and a noise-free Gaussian doublet are studied via simulation. The results indicate that the contrast and resolution loss of the {SGDD} depends on the ratio of the width of signal derivative and filter length. The linear {SGDD} is not preferable for preserving small details of signal derivative from this study.

The model was built using data collected from Hancock Agricultural Research Station, {WI}, {USA} in 2020 and was validated using samples collected in 2021 for four different conditions. The conditions included two sites (Coloma and Hancock), four potato varieties (Burbank, Norkotah, Goldrush, and Silverton), two N rates (unfertilized and 308 kg N ha−1), and four growth stages (vegetative, tuber initiation, tuber bulking, and tuber maturation). The calibration and validation models had high predictive performance for leaf total N with R2 {\textbackslash}textgreater 0.8 and {RPD} {\textbackslash}textgreater 2. The model accuracy was affected by the total N contents in the leaf samples where the model underpredicted the samples with total leaf N contents greater than 6\%.},

In this study, principal component and hierarchical clustering analyses have been compared for their ability to provide different representative calibration sets. The calibration sets generated have been used to control the technological maturity of grapes and total phenolic compounds of grape skins in red and white cultivars. Finally, the accuracy and precision of the models obtained with these calibration sets resulted from the application of the selection algorithms studied have been compared with each other and with the whole set of samples using an external validation set. Most of the standard errors of prediction ({SEP}) in external validation obtained from the reduced data sets were not significantly different from those obtained using the whole data set.

	abstract = {There is uncertainty on how generally applicable near-infrared reflectance spectroscopy ({NIRS}) calibrations are across genotypes and environments, and this study tests how well a single calibration performs across a wide range of conditions. We also address the optimization of {NIRS} to perform the analysis of crude protein ({CP}) content in a variety of cowpea accessions (n = 561) representing genotypic variation as well as grown in a wide range of environmental conditions in Tanzania and Uganda. The samples were submitted to {NIRS} analysis and a predictive calibration model developed. A modified partial least-squares regression with cross-validation was used to evaluate the models and identify possible spectral outliers. Calibration statistics for {CP} suggests that {NIRS} can predict this parameter in a wide range of cowpea leaves from different agro-ecological zones of eastern Africa with high accuracy (R2cal = 0.93; standard error of cross-validation = 0.74). {NIRS} analysis improved when a calibration set was developed from samples selected to represent the range of spectral variability. We conclude from the present results that this technique is a good alternative to chemical analysis for the determination of {CP} contents in leaf samples from cowpea in the African context, as one of the main advantages of {NIRS} is the large number of compounds that can be measured at once in the same sample, thus substantially reducing the cost per analysis. The current model is applicable in predicting the {CP} content of young cowpea leaves for human nutrition from different agro-ecological zones and genetic materials, as cowpea leaves are one of the popular vegetables in the region.},

	abstract = {Near infrared transmittance and reflectance instruments were compared for the determination of protein, oil, moisture and some other constituents and parameters in several grains and seeds of commerce. Both approaches were comparable in accuracy and reproducibility. The importance of optimisation of the wavelength range in whole grain analysis is demonstrated for measurements in both the {NIR} and visible/{NlR} wavelength ranges. The {RPD} statistic, which relates the standard error of prediction to the standard deviation of the original data, is illustrated as a method for the evaluation of calibrations. The concept of monitoring the accuracy of analysis using whole grain calibrations with ground grain calibrations is introduced.},

	abstract = {Interest in hemp as a multi-purpose crop is growing worldwide and for the first time in 2015 it was cultivated in Europe on more than 20.000ha as a dual-purpose crop, for the seeds and for the fibre. In the present study, fibre and seed productivity of 14 commercial cultivars were tested in four contrasting European environments (Latvia, the Czech Republic, France, Italy). At full flowering, the stem yield ranged from 3.7Mgha−1 to 22.7Mgha−1, the bast fibre content ranged from 21\% to 43\%, and the bast fibre yield ranged from 1.3Mgha−1 to 7.4Mgha−1. When harvesting was postponed from full flowering until seed maturity, the stem yield of monoecious cultivars significantly increased but in dioecious cultivars it decreased at all tested sites, except for Italy. Only the early cultivars Fedora 17 and Markant produced seed in the most northern location Latvia. The seed yield ranged from 0.3Mgha−1 to 2.4Mgha−1 in Italy, France and the Czech Republic. The cultivar effect on stem and seed yield was mainly determined by the genetic variation in time of flowering. Stem yield at full flowering was strictly related to the duration of the vegetative phase while seed yield was lowest in the late flowering cultivar. The late cultivar {CS} is suitable for stem and fibre production as it had the highest stem yield at full flowering in all locations. Both Fedora 17 and Futura 75 are candidate cultivars for dual-purpose production in Italy, France and the Czech Republic, with Fedora 17 being more suitable for seed production and Futura 75 for fibre production. The application of modelling to design production strategies for dual-purpose hemp is promising. However, accurate parameterisation is needed based on large data sets and diverse genetic background.},

	abstract = {The potential of near infrared ({NIR}) spectroscopy for non-destructive determination of quality parameters including oil and protein contents in shell-intact cottonseed was investigated. Linear partial least squares ({PLS}) and nonlinear least-squares support vector machine ({LS}-{SVM}) methods were used to develop the calibration models to determinate the protein and oil contents. Moreover, as variable selection techniques, the Monte Carlo uninformative variable elimination ({MC}-{UVE}) and the successive projections algorithm ({SPA}) were applied to improve the predictive ability of the model. Finally, the {MC}-{UVE}–{LS}-{SVM} models show the best prediction performance. The coefficient of determination (R2), residual predictive deviation ({RPD}) and root mean squares error of prediction ({RMSEP}) were 0.959, 4.871 and 0.977 for protein, and 0.950, 4.429 and 0.834 for oil, respectively. The results indicate that {NIR} technology could be very useful for the rapid quality analysis of shell-intact cottonseed avoiding the need of grinding. Furthermore, the variable selection of {MC}-{UVE} can provide more robust and accurate calibration models than {SPA}.},

	abstract = {This study compares the application of two variable selection methods in partial least squares regression ({PLSR}), the variable importance in projection ({VIP}) method and the selectivity ratio ({SR}) method. For this purpose, three different data sets were analysed: (a) physiochemical water quality parameters related to sensorial data, (b) gas chromatography–mass spectrometry ({GC}-{MS}) chemical (organic compound) profiles from fossil sea sediment samples related to sea surface temperature ({SST}) changes, and (c) exposed genes of Daphnia magna female samples related to their total offspring production. Correlation coefficients (r), levels of significance (p-value) and interpretation of the underlying experimental phenomena allowed the discussion about the best approach for variable selection in each case. The comparison of the two variable selection methods in the first water quality data set showed that the {SR} method is more accurate for sensorial prediction. For the climate data set, when raw total ion current ({TIC}) {GC}-{MS} chromatograms were considered, variables selected using the {VIP} method were easier to interpret compared with those selected by the {SR} method. However, when only some chromatographic peak areas (concentrations) were considered, the {SR} method was more efficient for prediction, and the {VIP} method selected the most relevant variables for the interpretation of {SST} changes. Finally, for the transcriptomic data set, the {SR} method was found again to be more reliable for prediction purposes. Copyright © 2015 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},
